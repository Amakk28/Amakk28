My name is Abrar Makki, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My passion for software engineering was ignited during my first year at UIC, where I was introduced to the world of coding and problem-solving. The collaborative environment and innovative projects at UIC have further fueled my enthusiasm for creating efficient and impactful software solutions. 

I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including C++, C, Java, and Python, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.
Additionally, I have a strong foundation in data structures, computer architecture, advanced algorithms, and other key areas of computer science.
